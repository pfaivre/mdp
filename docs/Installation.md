## Installation

mdp has been tested on Windows 7 and Linux Mint 17.2, but it should work on
other platforms.

It depends on:
* Python 3
* [Pyperclip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyperclip/1.5.11)
* [pycrypto](https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/)
* [Urwid](http://urwid.org/) (Optional, not on Windows)

### Windows
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* pycrypto. You can download binaries for Python 3.4 [here](https://github.com/axper/python3-pycrypto-windows-installer).
* Pyperclip. Open a Command window and type `pip3 install pyperclip`

### Debian and derivative
These commands will install everything you need:
```bash
$ sudo pip3 install pyperclip
$ sudo apt-get install python3-urwid
```
Python 3 an pycrypto are already shipped with the system.

## Usage

Just extract and execute `mdp.py` on a terminal.
